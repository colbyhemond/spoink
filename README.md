Story Pointing Web Application

Vision: To create mobile responsive web application that allows teams to make their story pointing meetings more efficient by allowing team members to vote using their phone and see all stories on a team dashboard. 

Spoink story pointing will be a valuable option for agile teams who have team members that work remotely, in office, or a mix of both!

Think Trello, JackBox Games, and your good old fashioned in person stoy point meeting.
